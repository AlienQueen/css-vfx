#summary Introduction to CSS Visual Effects

== Introduction ==

Welcome to *css-vfx*, a collection of components and code examples that illustrate the power of CSS Visual Effects. So far, only 1 gem that illustrates a popular RIA user interface demo, "Cover Flow" is currently available. If you'd like to see more, please don't hesitate to suggest something you'd like to see.

Try out the demos, take a look at the source, and have fun! -- [http://www.satine.org/ Charles Ying]
